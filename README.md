This repo is to store my maths scripts that automatizes some task on some exercises like statisitcs.
All files in this repo are made for calculator which supports python as **casio 90+e** or **casio35+e II** and other.

I recommend you to look in the [tips repository](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/tree/main/tips) before getting started if you're new to using python scripts on calculator.
