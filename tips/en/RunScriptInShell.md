In this file i will explain how to use python shell faster on calculator (for my example i use a casio 90+e but it should work on every calculator)

# Run a program in the python shell faster

On Casio, when you run a program in python it is only launched once. And at the end of it we must go back to the explorer and restart the program or rewrite the function on the shell (unless we use a while loop). I'll show you how to get around this:

*The code of the program (very human)*

![code](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/blob/main/images/screenshots/RunScriptInShell_1.png?raw=true "Code")

*running the script*

![shell](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/blob/main/images/screenshots/RunScriptInShell_2.png?raw=true "shell")
"hello world" have been printed

*This output line says that every function of the script got imported (so the function is hello() ) *

![import](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/blob/main/images/screenshots/RunScriptInShell_3.png?raw=true "import de fonctions1")
![import](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/blob/main/images/screenshots/RunScriptInShell_4.png?raw=true "import de fonctions2")

*I can use the function of the script by rewriting them in the shell*

![hello](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/blob/main/images/screenshots/RunScriptInShell_5.png?raw=true "utilisation de la fonction hello()")
Hello world have been printed

*By scrolling on the previous lines in the shell, i can copy the highlighted line by pressing exe (or enter) and it will pasted on the input line*

![copie](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/blob/main/images/screenshots/RunScriptInShell_6.png?raw=true "copié")

*for the following exmples i copied some lines, the screenshots below are the last lines of shell (for the inout)*

![colle](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/blob/main/images/screenshots/RunScriptInShell_8.png?raw=true "collé_1")
![colle](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/blob/main/images/screenshots/RunScriptInShell_9.png?raw=true "collé_2")

So by by printing the name of the function by adding a line in the code which is print(‘function()’), we can run the script faster:

![code_2](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/blob/main/images/screenshots/RunScriptInShell_10.png?raw=true "code_2")
« hello() » is printed and ready to be copied.


![shell_2](https://github.com/1Tyron140/maths/blob/main/images/screenshots/RunScriptInShell_11.png?raw=true "shell_22")

Voila, now you can run faster in the shell by coping a line and running it without having to rewrite the function by yourself.
